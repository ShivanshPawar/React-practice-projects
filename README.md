# ⚛️ React Mini Practice Projects

Welcome to my **React Mini Projects Collection** — a growing set of small, creative React.js projects I’m building to sharpen my frontend and UI/UX development skills. Each project focuses on a specific concept or technique — from hooks and state management to animations and API integrations.

## 🚀 About This Repo

This repo is my **personal React playground** — where I experiment, learn, and refine my React skills by building real mini apps and UI components.

Every project is built using:
- ⚛️ **React.js**
- 💨 **Tailwind CSS / SCSS**
- 🎬 **GSAP / Framer Motion** (for animations)
- 🔄 **Reusable Components + Hooks**
- ⚙️ Sometimes **APIs or LocalStorage**
